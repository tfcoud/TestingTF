2. cidr_block for subnet
3. avilability zone var
4. environment variabke as such {dev, staging, prod}

#Second part

to create custom route tabe and internet gateway
1. creating igw for our vpc...as defaut vpc have default igw
2. getting this newly created igw as record in our route table.
default route table have d-vpc enrty and d-igw entry, so we need to add igw in ths tb.

#Third part

#Fourth part

ways to use route table--default and custom-----vpc config and internet gateway config

#Fifth part
